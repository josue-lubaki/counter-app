## Architecture
Counter-app is based on the MVI architecture. The MVI architecture is a unidirectional data flow architecture that is based on the principles of reactive programming. It is a great fit for Android development because it is easy to understand, test, and maintain. It also provides a consistent and reliable user experience.
